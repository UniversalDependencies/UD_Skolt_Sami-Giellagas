# Summary

UD Skolt Sami is the original annotation (CoNLL-U) for texts in the Skolt Sami language,
it originally consists of twenty translated sentences made by Hilkka Fofonoff from the 
Finnish texts: [here](http://ilazki.thinkgeek.co.uk/brat/#/uralic/fin). Subsequent sentences
come from the Giellagas Corpus of Spoken Saami Languages of the University of Oulu, Finland, which, in part, 
include research materials transferred from «Kotus» 'Institute for the Languages of Finland'.

# Acknowledgments

The original annotations have been performed by Jack Rueter at the University of Helsinki and Markus Juutinen at the 
Giellagas Institute (University of Oulu, Finland) using morphological tools developed with funding from a Kone Foundation 
«Language Programme» funded project: «Skolt Sami Revitalization through Intelligent Computer-assisted Language Learning 
means and the development of guidelines for transfering these methods to other threatened languages» (2015–2018) with 
the linguistic consultation of Merja Fofonoff and Eino Koponen.
The tools used have been facilitated through the open-source Giella infrastructure at the Norwegian Arctic University in Tromsø.

Work with the Skolt Sami treebank builds upon previous experience with the UD_Erzya-JR treebank as well as growing discussions
with Francis Tyers, Tommi Pirinen, Jonathan Washington, Mika Hämäläinen and Niko Partanen. Without the Skolt Sami speakers and writers themselves, 
however, we would be no where…
